# Contributing

We love pull requests from everyone.
By participating in this project,
you agree to abide by the thoughtbot [code of conduct].

We expect everyone to follow the code of conduct
anywhere in thoughtbot's project codebases,
issue trackers, chatrooms, and mailing lists.

1. Fork the repo.

2. Run `./bin/setup`.

3. Run the tests. We only take pull requests with passing tests, and it's great
   to know that you have a clean slate: `bundle exec appraisal rake`

4. Add a test for your change. Only refactoring and documentation changes
   require no new tests. If you are adding functionality or fixing a
   bug, we need a test!

5. Make the test pass.

6. Write a [good commit message][commit].

7. Push to your fork and submit a pull request.

Others will give constructive feedback.
This is a time for discussion and improvements,
and making the necessary changes will be required before we can
merge the contribution.
