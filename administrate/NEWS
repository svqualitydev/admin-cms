New in 0.0.5:

* Compatibility: Administrate relies on the `&-suffix` feature of SASS,
  which was [released in 3.3.0], as well as using `&` in SassScript,
  which was [released in 3.4.0]. We've declared an explicit dependency
  on `sass ~> 3.4`.

[released in 3.3.0]: http://sass-lang.com/documentation/file.SASS_CHANGELOG.html#330_7_march_2014
[released in 3.4.0]: http://sass-lang.com/documentation/file.SASS_CHANGELOG.html#340_18_august_2014

  the dashboard generator for each resource it finds.
