New in 0.0.4:

* Improvement: Use [selectize.js](http://brianreavis.github.io/selectize.js/)
  to improve has_many form field interaction.
* Interface: remove the "Show" link from tables - it was redundant because
  clicking on the row itself took the user to the same place.

New in 0.0.3:

  the dashboard generator for each resource it finds.
* Compatibility: Relax the required version of Neat down to ~> 1.1.0
